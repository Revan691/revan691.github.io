    <p class="paragraph center">Odin is my favourite ship overall. It has smaller caliber guns than most ships of its tier, however that gives it a slight advantage over lightly armoured targets.</p>
    <p class="paragraph center">Odin has turtleback armour; meaning the closer you are to the ship, the more armour your shells have to penetrate to cause major damage. Most shells being shot towards the bow (nose) and within 9km will ricochet, whereas large calliber shells fired
        at 10km+ will arc and penetrate the deck armour.</p>

    <ul class="paragraph bground">
        <li class="minititle">Key Points</li>
        <li>Armed with 3x3 305mm main guns, a much smaller caliber compared to other battleships in it's class. It has great penetration against cruisers, but less so against other battleships.</li>
        <li>Strong armour at -10km range, vulnerable to long range and close up broadside shots</li>
        <li>Good top speed & great maneuverability compared to other battleships of the same tier</li>
        <li>Excellent secondary batteries and close range torpedoes make it perfect for brawling</li>

        <img src="image/Yamato.png" height="500" width="900" alt="WoWS Legends Yamato Img">
        <p class="paragraph center">
            Yamato, weighing 72,800 tons, was the biggest warship of WW2 & the largest battleship in the world. It was built based on the idea that a single ship could overpower any enemy it came up against.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph center">
            Yamato was armed with 18 inch main guns and immensely superior armour and torpedo protection, making ship vs ship combat with this floating fortress an unlikely situation...
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph center">
            Despite having a whopping 72 AA turrets ranging from 25mm to 127mm, it wasn't enough to save her from numerous aerial bombing runs. She sank after taking multiple torpedo hits.

            <li>Armed with 3x3 460mm main battery guns, she had the largest guns in all of the world navies at the time</li>
            <li>Vastly superior armour and torpedo protection compared to other battleships</li>
            <li>Overwhelming secondary battery and AA defense</li>

        <p class="paragraph center">
            Kamikaze, the underdog with a lethal sneaky streak!
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph center">
            Kamikaze was a small and stealthy destroyer. It was the first purpose built torpedo destroyer. It had 3 twin torpedo launchers that had a very quick reload time.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph center">
            The Japanese were the first to engineer oxygen fuelled torpedoes which dramatically increased their speed & yield! Kamikaze was also exceptionally fast, due to her being a very small ship, even compared to other destroyers.

            <li>Difficult to detect, making it great at ambushing opponents</li>
            <li>Rapid torpedo reload catches at least 50% of players out, you will feel their rage when you show them what's what!</li>
            <li>A very light ship, even compared to other destroyers. Play carefully</li>
            <li>If you play well with Kamikaze, prepare to recieve hatemail & be accused of cheating</li>
